This also makes them difficult to find. Cherry shrimp (and their color varieties) will also be no threat to your fish. But, they are very small, so aggressive fish (barbs, for example) may go after them. They breed quite easily and rapidly, so if you want more of them make sure you have plenty of hiding places for the young shrimp. Cherry shrimp are also algae eaters, though being so small you'll need huge quantities of them to have an real impact if algae controll is a goal. Really, for most shrimp in tanks, the issue isn't if they are a danger to the fish, but if the fish will be a danger to the shrimps. Even larger shrimp may find their extremities and tails the target of nipping. The tetras shouldn't be a problem for the shrimp, but the loaches may go after them. Edit: One heads up about shrimp (and most aquarium invertebrates, actually). A lot of medications and chemicals you might use in a tank are poisonous to them. So once they are in there, you'll need to be extra careful with what you put into the tank, and check that it is safe for shrimp.\"\n        },\n        {\n            \"pid\": \"5178\",\n            \"text\": \"I don't have any experience with ghost shrimp, but I do have cherry shrimps. And it seems like they are pretty much alike in behaviour, size, care taking, ... Shrimp are a lot different than fish, their bio footprint is a lot lower, they are a lot smaller,... So I would not use such calculators to see how many you can have. They usually just take the size of the fish and do some calculations (which is not a good way anyway). This site seems to have some good information about ghost shrimp and it mentions 10 shrimp/gallon. But I agree with Karl's comment above: it doesn't really matter. But make sure you have more shrimp than tetra's. Actually I would say: the more shrimp the better. I've got a 30 litre (8 gallon) tank with only cherry shrimp. I started with about 20 shrimp I believe (1.5 year ago). Now I probably have close to 100. But I don't have the feeling it is overstocked. They're always spread out over the tank or swimming around. It's only when I feed them that they all come to the same place and you actually see how many there are. I also have a 180 litres (47 gallon) tank with some corrydoras, tetra's and a betta in which I added about 15 shrimp a couple of months ago. I have no idea how many shrimp I have now (lot's of hiding places), but I always have about 10 in sight. So I'm sure those 15 shrimp were enough to keep the population steady (and growing). So for you, it would start with at least 10-15 shrimp and see how it goes. And I would not worry too much about having to do population control. More baby shrimp will also mean that more will be eaten by the tetra's anyway (becasue they will be easier to spot by them).\"\n        },\n        {\n            \"pid\": \"4573\",\n            \"text\": \"I actually have 4 Yoyo loaches, two cory dorus (SP) and 5 cherry shrimp.

From your other post, it seems like your tank won't have many hiding places for the shrimp. So you might want to add a few real plants and moss (shrimp will love this) and a shrimp cave.

You can use the fact that they are alive to determine that they are reasonably safe to eat. However frozen shrimp do not have that built-in check. The FDA and other agencies will \\\"police\\\" commercially available frozen shrimp, but they don't do anything for bait shrimp. Frozen bait shrimp are usually the dead, dying, or otherwise discarded live bait shrimp. It's not uncommon for a bait shop to sell live shrimp, then take all the dead \\\"floaters\\\" and sell them as frozen shrimp. Again, quite safe for bait, not so good for eating. Bait shrimp you freeze yourself has a similar issue. If you're eating the live bait shrimp, then you know, for a fact, how old and what condition the shrimp are in. If you happen to have a bait-well full of dead shrimp and freeze it, (again that's fine for bait,) you have no idea why the shrimp died. Moreover, if you \\\"collect\\\" frozen shrimp between trips, you probably didn't bother to mark the freeze date or freeze the shrimp quickly, or a bunch of other things. In essence, live shrimp you take from the bait-well and boil or try, you know the state of. Frozen (bait) shrimp has been rolling around in the freezer for an unknown amount of time. Well better that one just be bait. Now you could eat the frozen shrimp if you take great care in freezing it.

But I have done a lot of research on the fact (as much as I could, there's not a lot of easily accessible, reliable resources out there), since keeping varying types of shrimp together runs a number of breeding risks. You really can't tell who bred with who at this point, not until the shrimp eggs hatch, and the shrimps mature, which is only a matter of about 2 months (varies per type). Have you sexed your shrimp? You could make an educated guess based on your female to male ratios. (I.e., if your 1 Red Rili was female, you can remove that shrimp as a possible parent of your current eggs.) It's important to know that it's not uncommon for crossbred (breeding between different species) shrimp to return to \\\"wild\\\" coloring (brown), instead of taking on one of a parent's trait. Interbreeding (breeding between same species) is more likely to keep the vibrant colors. There's a number of helpful interbreeding and crossbreeding charts you should check out, which can help you narrow down if who might have bred with who, if some parings wouldn't be possible. I felt that this article was particularly useful, and has a chart linked at the end: Interbreeding Chart. For example: it is possible for your Blue Velvet to have bred with your Red Cherry, but is highly likely to produce a brown shrimp. (a lot of shrimp have varying names, or are falsely labeled, so you may need to look up the specific genus of each of your shrimp to match them up on that chart.) I'd also like to note that, if you have a fish that is killing your shrimp, the baby shrimp may not live long enough for you to tell. I would recommend keeping your breeding and baby shrimp separate from the fish.\"\n        },\n        {\n            \"pid\": \"2763\",\n            \"text\": \"Shrimp are more active at lower lighting and during complete blackouts (nighttime).

But, they are very small, so aggressive fish (barbs, for example) may go after them.

Cherry shrimp are also algae eaters, though being so small you'll need huge quantities of them to have an real impact if algae controll is a goal. Really, for most shrimp in tanks, the issue isn't if they are a danger to the fish, but if the fish will be a danger to the shrimps. Even larger shrimp may find their extremities and tails the target of nipping. The tetras shouldn't be a problem for the shrimp, but the loaches may go after them.

Use rasboras or fish like Boraras brigittae or Poecilia wingei, these fish can eat zoeas so you need to put plants in your tank to make refuges for your shrimp. Other examples: Celestichthys margaritatus Hemigrammus rodwayi Ember Tetra Flame Tetra Crystal Red Tetra You can try to put \\\"big fish\\\" in your tank, like Metynnis argenteus, this is an herbivorous fish and is cool to see when it grows to its maximum size. They don't attack other fishes. Surface fish like hatchet fish can be a good option in this tank, because the shrimp are bottom dwellers of the tank. You have another great options here, just make a search and you can find some good candidates for the aquarium. Bad options: Single Betta male, this is a really aggressive and territorial fish so you will have problems with other fish in the tank and with the shrimps. Pentazona barbs or other barbs are a big problem, because these guys grow to a significant size and you will lose all your shrimp if they find them. If you put assassin snails without putting others snails, assassin snails will die because they eat other snails, so you would need to feed them with other snails.

It's not uncommon for a bait shop to sell live shrimp, then take all the dead \\\"floaters\\\" and sell them as frozen shrimp. Again, quite safe for bait, not so good for eating. Bait shrimp you freeze yourself has a similar issue. If you're eating the live bait shrimp, then you know, for a fact, how old and what condition the shrimp are in. If you happen to have a bait-well full of dead shrimp and freeze it, (again that's fine for bait,) you have no idea why the shrimp died.

They'll ignore your fish altogether. And they eat algae 24x7, which never hurts. Amano shrimp require brackish water for breeding, so won't breed in most tanks. This also makes them difficult to find. Cherry shrimp (and their color varieties) will also be no threat to your fish. But, they are very small, so aggressive fish (barbs, for example) may go after them. They breed quite easily and rapidly, so if you want more of them make sure you have plenty of hiding places for the young shrimp. Cherry shrimp are also algae eaters, though being so small you'll need huge quantities of them to have an real impact if algae controll is a goal. Really, for most shrimp in tanks, the issue isn't if they are a danger to the fish, but if the fish will be a danger to the shrimps. Even larger shrimp may find their extremities and tails the target of nipping. The tetras shouldn't be a problem for the shrimp, but the loaches may go after them. Edit: One heads up about shrimp (and most aquarium invertebrates, actually). A lot of medications and chemicals you might use in a tank are poisonous to them. So once they are in there, you'll need to be extra careful with what you put into the tank, and check that it is safe for shrimp.\"\n        },\n        {\n            \"doc_id\": \"5702\",\n            \"score\": -4.189998626708984,\n            \"text\": \"As you've already pointed out, the best course of action is to quarantine the fish. If you really can't do this then you'll need to tread carefully with medicines if you have any invertebrates (snails, shrimp) or fish without scales (bristlenose catfish, loaches, etc.). Ultimately, this comes down to reading the label of the medicine. There is such a smorgasbord of different medicines that it's difficult to put a hard and fast rule on which to use (they almost always warn you about the fish that might react adversely). While reading the label, you'll definitely want to check that the medicine \\\"doesn't harm your filter\\\" and whilst many claim they won't, there is a chance that it could negatively impact your beneficial bacteria anyway. Remember that when you add medicine to a tank, you change what the water contains. This can be stressful for fish which are healthy or fighting off an issue already. I've had great success with Melafix and Pimafix together as a 'general cure' and my catfish, snails and loaches have not had any issue. Whether this will work for dropsy on an older fish anyway, that's difficult to say. As ever, my overriding advice would be to keep your water quality as clean and consistent as you possibly can during periods of ill-health. The consistency is important because big changes in your water can tip sick fish over the edge. Finally, older or stressed fish can become more susceptible to ill health which might explain why dropsy (normally occurring in poor water conditions) has happened in a tank with good quality. After thought: Remember the cost of this! Medicating a whole tank can be much more expensive than medicating a smaller tank.\"\n        },\n        {\n            \"doc_id\": \"70166\",\n            \"score\": -5.462036609649658,\n            \"text\": \"Live shrimp are just that, alive.

Frozen bait shrimp are usually the dead, dying, or otherwise discarded live bait shrimp. It's not uncommon for a bait shop to sell live shrimp, then take all the dead \\\"floaters\\\" and sell them as frozen shrimp. Again, quite safe for bait, not so good for eating. Bait shrimp you freeze yourself has a similar issue. If you're eating the live bait shrimp, then you know, for a fact, how old and what condition the shrimp are in. If you happen to have a bait-well full of dead shrimp and freeze it, (again that's fine for bait,) you have no idea why the shrimp died.

Assassin snails are actually fresh water Whelks... and are quite carnivorous. Once placed in the tank, the three of them I had brought home commenced what I can only describe as a war crime against the native snail population. Within about 6-8 weeks they had wiped out the snails. The substrate was littered with empty pond snail shells. There was not a snail to be seen. I am starting to see some ramshorn snails pop back into the picture now. But I havent seen a pond snail for a good 8 months. They are harmless to fish and shrimp. Though I imagine they will go after any fish or shrimp eggs they come across. They're also very fun to watch.

But, they are very small, so aggressive fish (barbs, for example) may go after them. They breed quite easily and rapidly, so if you want more of them make sure you have plenty of hiding places for the young shrimp. Cherry shrimp are also algae eaters, though being so small you'll need huge quantities of them to have an real impact if algae controll is a goal. Really, for most shrimp in tanks, the issue isn't if they are a danger to the fish, but if the fish will be a danger to the shrimps. Even larger shrimp may find their extremities and tails the target of nipping. The tetras shouldn't be a problem for the shrimp, but the loaches may go after them. Edit: One heads up about shrimp (and most aquarium invertebrates, actually). A lot of medications and chemicals you might use in a tank are poisonous to them.

You can use the fact that they are alive to determine that they are reasonably safe to eat. However frozen shrimp do not have that built-in check.

Frozen bait shrimp are usually the dead, dying, or otherwise discarded live bait shrimp. It's not uncommon for a bait shop to sell live shrimp, then take all the dead \\\"floaters\\\" and sell them as frozen shrimp. Again, quite safe for bait, not so good for eating. Bait shrimp you freeze yourself has a similar issue. If you're eating the live bait shrimp, then you know, for a fact, how old and what condition the shrimp are in. If you happen to have a bait-well full of dead shrimp and freeze it, (again that's fine for bait,) you have no idea why the shrimp died.

(bold format from me) https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neocaridina_davidi About breeding: N. davidi shrimp reach sexual maturity when they are around 4â€“6 months old. Breeding only requires a sexed pair of shrimp, stable water parameters, and a food source.[10] Eggs may be observed developing in the female's ovaries as a green or yellow triangular \\\"saddle\\\" marking on her back. When she is ready to lay the eggs, which occurs after molting, she releases pheromones into the water to signal her availability to males. The male shrimp in the tank will often become agitated, swimming very actively about as they search for the source of the pheromones. After a brief mating process, during which the male deposits sperm onto the female's body, the female lays her eggs and affixes them to her swimmerettes. The eggs are not fertilized within the female; they are fertilized as they pass from the ovaries to the outside of the body. Therefore, it is certain that any shrimp carrying eggs has mated. A female carrying eggs under her abdomen is said to be \\\"berried\\\".[citation needed] Some report that young female shrimp carrying their first clutch of eggs tend to drop some or all of the eggs, possibly due to inexperience or small size.[11] If a berried shrimp is stressed by predators or poor water conditions she may also abandon the eggs.[12] So if the eggs are already under her \\\"tail\\\", fertilization already happened. The eggs still take some time to hatch. Be aware that a female shrimp that feels scared, vulnerable or inexperienced might drop the eggs. Being transported from petshop to home and entering a new aquarium can be stressful for shrimps and it's very possible that those first eggs can be abandonned. (it happened like this for me in the past) Bright lights, fast movements and loud sounds can also scare shrimps. Many things matter with shrimp, safety and lots of cover and warmer water will help with breeding. Also plants and food and clean water. I advise you to google as much as you can about them. :) PS: never put aquarium salt or anything containing copper (including medication or snail killers) in the shrimp tank Hope that answered your question\"\n        },\n        {\n            \"doc_id\": \"23561\",\n            \"score\": 0.5229305028915405,\n            \"text\": \"In Ca. they call it a shrimp plant, Justicia brandegeeana.\"\n        }\n    ],\n    \"cosine_similarities\": [\n        0.6075128316879272,\n        0.5978125333786011,\n        0.5731650590896606,\n        0.5652762055397034,\n        0.5609471201896667,\n        0.5501911640167236,\n        0.5364816784858704,\n        0.5349738001823425,\n        0.5294570326805115,\n        0.5229305028915405\n    ],\n    \"top_documents_indices\": [\n        5159,\n        7323,\n        70163,\n        4573,\n        4162,\n        619,\n        70166,\n        55,\n        7720,\n        23561\n    ]\n}"
